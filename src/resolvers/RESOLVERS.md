# Resolvers

https://typegraphql.com/docs/0.17.0/resolvers.html

Resolvers are our CRUD operations -- our controller.

TypeGraphQL allows to create queries, mutations and field resolvers in an easy way - like a normal class methods, similar to REST controllers in frameworks like Java's Spring, .NET Web API or TypeScript's routing-controllers.
